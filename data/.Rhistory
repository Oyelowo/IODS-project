#By and large, we have almost twice as much female responsdent out of 166 students
#aside those with examination point 0. The average age is about 26 years with
#the youngest being 17 years and an old student of age 55. The ages of the
#respondents are mainly skewed to the right, showing they are mostly young students
#below 26 years
#Choose three variables as explanatory variables and fit a regression model
#where exam points is the target (dependent) variable. Show a summary of
#the fitted model and comment and interpret the results. Explain and interpret
#the statistical test related to the model parameters. If an explanatory
#variable in your model does not have a statistically significant relationship
#with the target variable, remove the variable from the model and fit the model
#again without it. (0-4 points)
#I attempted to use all the variables for the model and stepwise regression
#to help remove the redundant variables.

#After using stepwise regression, I ended up with three explanatory variables namely:
#'age','attitude' and 'stra'
#now, let's refit the model with these three variables
l_model2<-lm(points ~ age + attitude + stra, data = lrn14)
summary(l_model2)
#As shown by the model, the p value of 'attitude' is very low below 0.05 and with
#higher confidence that 'attitude' significantly affects the examination points.
#However, the coeffient of determination(Multiple R-squared) of the model is just (0.2182)21.82% which is
#relatively low. The standard error of age is quite low and p value is not
#so high either. Hence, this can be incorporated into the model.
#However, even though, the standard error of strategic approach is relatively high with 0.53
#compared with age with 0.05, the p-value is lower. Based on this, I will remove the age because it is less significant.
#Finally, I am left with predictors; 'attitude' and 'strategic approach'.
#age seems to have a slightly negative effect while attitude and strategic approach has a positive effect.
#Just as points and age showed a low negative correlation earlier, it can be seen that
#age has a slight negative effect(-0.08821) on the examination poitns while attitude, which
#showed slightly higher positive correlation with points earlier, has  a positive
#effect(3.48143) on the examination points
#Final model
lm_final<-lm(points~stra+attitude, data = lrn14)
summary(lm_final)
#Although, the coefficient of determination(Multiple R-Squared) reduced slightly to 20.48% from 21.82%
#and the standard error only increased from 5.26 to 5.289. The difference difference
#is not so drastic. The p-value is also well below 0.05.
#with the 'Ã¤ttitude' and 'strategeic approach', I got a higher Multiple R-squared of 0.2048 compared to
#0.2011 when I used age and attitude. Thus, I decided to use 'attitude' and 'strategic approach'.
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(lm_final, which = c(1,2,5))
#As seen in the Normal Q-Q plot, the points fit well to the line, aside few deviations
#at the beginning and end. The errors can thus, be said to be normally distributed.
#for the residuals vs fitted, it can be seen that there is a slight change as the values inceas.
#However, no observation seems to have clear leverage over others.
